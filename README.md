# <WhereToEat>

## Description

Where to eat is a restaurant randomizer application that allows users to get a lunch or dinner idea with just a click of a button.

- As I was sdutying or I was in office It was always hard to figure out where should I have my lunch, so I thought why there isn't an application that give me an idea for a lunch destination in a simple and easy way.
- I created this project to challenge my skills and to perhaps create something others can use and make their life a bit easier.
- My application definitely solves the problem of putting too mch time into searching lunch locations.
- During the development of the application I learned how to best connect front and backend, use new technologies like Redux.

## Installation

  bundle install
  npm install --prefix client

To launch the application in your terminal:
  foreman start -f Procfile.dev (this allows both backend and frontend server to run in 1 window)
  or 
  npm start 
  rails s
